refplat-images-docker (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * CI / release: workflow guard and logging
    - Run metadata guard only for downstream `workflow_run` events to avoid
    unnecessary checks on tag/manual runs
    - Add explicit log steps for tag pushes and manual `workflow_dispatch`
    runs for clearer diagnostics and accurate logging
    - Install `jq` with `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and
    `--no-install-recommends`; clean apt lists and documentation paths to
    reduce runner bloat
    - Prefer the pushed git tag when creating Releases; implement a robust
    tag-selection order and sanity checks to avoid malformed `tag_name` errors

  * Automation: tagging helper
    - Added `tag-release.sh` to help select a successful `build.yml` run and
    create an annotated (optionally signed) tag that points at the built
    commit

  * Documentation
    - Added `TAGGING.md` describing how to create tags that match CI build
    runs
    - Added `VERIFICATION.md` with instructions for importing the project
    public key and verifying detached GPG signatures for release artifacts

refplat-images-docker (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * CI / release: split workflows and signing improvements
    - Split build and release workflows: build job produces artifacts; release
    job downloads, signs, and publishes them
    - Import GPG key and create detached ASCII signatures for artifacts
    (*.asc); attempt Debian-style signing of .changes with debsign
    - Ensure gh CLI is available and use `gh release upload` to attach
    multiple files, including signatures
    - Upload artifacts and signatures to GitHub Release; improved artifact
    upload robustness and metadata handling
  * Build metadata
    - Restore timestamp (ts) in build-metadata.json for traceability
  * Packaging
    - Fixed changelog formatting to comply with dpkg tools

refplat-images-docker (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * CI / release workflow and Makefile improvements
    - Added release workflow to build and publish Debian artifacts only
    - Ensured the release pipeline creates a tarball alongside image artifacts
  * Build controls via .disabled also for local builds
  * Set platform to x86_64 for Docker builds to improve cross-host consistency
  * Documentation and repository cleanup
    - Added a compose section to README.md
    - Multiple README and docs updates and cleanups to reflect new workflow
    and artifact formats
    - Renamed/normalized artifact naming to use .tar.gz where appropriate

refplat-images-docker (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * better freeRADIUS container with proper logging and command line
    configuration. E.g. ARGS in the environment file can be used to provide
    the command line arguments for freeRADIUS. Also uses tini and unbuffer
    (from the expect package) to allow for both colored logging and logging
    into a file in addition to stdout. tini is used for process control.
  * uses entrypoint for the net-tools container now to allow for display of
    /etc/issue at start.
  * updated to Chrome 140.0.7339.127-1 and Firefox 143.0+build1
  * updated Thousandeyes to 1.223.0, ability to specify hostname via env var
  * updated Splunk to 10.0.0 (also needed new SPLUNK_GENERAL_TERMS env var)
  * changed name of xrd to ios-xrd-control-plane
  * turned off netflow container
  * added repo blurb files
