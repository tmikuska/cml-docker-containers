refplat-images-docker (1.5) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * better freeRADIUS container with proper logging and command line
    configuration. E.g. ARGS in the environment file can be used to provide
    the command line arguments for freeRADIUS. Also uses tini and unbuffer
    (from the expect package) to allow for both colored logging and logging
    into a file in addition to stdout. tini is used for process control.
  * uses entrypoint for the net-tools container now to allow for display of
    /etc/issue at start.
  * updated to Chrome 139.0.7258.127-1 and Firefox 141.0.3~build1
  * updated Thousandeyes to 1.221.0

  * changed name of xrd to ios-xrd-control-plane
