# Netflow image

Originally asked for cflowd but this is outdated / doesn't exist anymore:

<https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/cflowd/>

The page refers to flow-tools where some references are still around, like the
man page here:

<https://packages.debian.org/buster/amd64/net/flow-tools>

It also exists as a Debian package but only in Buster, doesn't exist in
Bookworm anymore. So, this image uses Buster as a baseline.

<https://packages.debian.org/buster/amd64/net/flow-tools>
