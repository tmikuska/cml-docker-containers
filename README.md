# Automation for building CML Docker Containers

This repository automates building Docker images and the node/image definition files used by Cisco Modeling Labs (CML). It produces artifacts and a Debian package (.deb) that can be installed on a CML server. The output mirrors the CML server layout so artifacts can be copied directly to `/var/lib/libvirt/images/...`.

## Project overview

This repository contains automation and templates to build container images, node definitions and image definitions for use with CML (tested for CML 2.9+). Most container specs in this repository pull software from Docker Hub or public resources; a few require additional manual content (see Special nodes).

## Quickstart

Build everything locally:

```sh
# build all enabled containers and generate definitions
make

# build a single container (development)
make -C <container-dir>

# build the Debian package (requires packaging tools)
make deb
```

Inspect generated files and package:

- Definitions and images: `BUILD/debian/refplat-images-docker/var/lib/libvirt/images/...`
- Debian package: `*.deb`, `*.buildinfo`, `*.changelog`

## Dependencies

Recommended environment: Ubuntu 24.04 (local VM or developer machine).

Required for building and packaging:

- Docker (engine/CLI)

For building the .deb package you also need:

- dpkg-dev
- devscripts
- fakeroot
- debhelper
- build-essential

If you only need to build images (no Debian package), you only need `make` and Docker.

## How discovery & selection work

- Discovery: the build system (and CI) scans top-level subdirectories for a `Dockerfile`. Each such directory is treated as a container specification.
- Skip / opt-out: to exclude a container from builds (both local and CI), place an empty file named `.disabled` in that container directory (for example: `chrome/.disabled`). The top-level Makefile and per-directory recipes honor this file and will skip building and definition generation, printing a clear message.
- Output layout: builders and templates create the YAML files and image tarballs under `BUILD/debian/refplat-images-docker/var/lib/libvirt/images/...` so the structure matches what CML expects on the server.

## Building (local development)

1. Build a single container:

```sh
make chrome   # example: builds chrome container and definitions
```

1. Build everything:

```sh
make
```

1. Build the Debian package:

```sh
make deb
```

**Notes:**

- Per-container Makefiles usually soft-link to  `../templates/build.mk`. Use an existing container (for example `chrome/` or `nginx/`) as a template when adding a new container.
- If a `.disabled` file exists in a container directory, `make -C <dir>` will skip building that container and print a message.

## Results (what is produced & where)

- Image tarballs and YAML definitions are placed under:

```plain
BUILD/debian/refplat-images-docker/var/lib/libvirt/images/<...>
```

- The Debian package is produced as `<package>.deb` (see `make deb`).

The generated tree mirrors the CML server layout so files may be copied to `/var/lib/libvirt/images/...` on the server.

## Contributing: Adding a new container

Follow these guidelines to add a container that builds locally and in CI.

Minimum directory layout (required files)

```plain
mycontainer/
  Dockerfile                 # required for discovery
  Makefile                   # usually: soft-link to ../templates/build.mk
  vars.mk                    # required metadata (see below)
  node-definition            # required: template used for node YAML
```

**Important:** `node-definition` is required: the `definitions` recipe uses this template to create the YAML file placed in the `BUILD/debian/refplat-images-docker/` tree.

Minimum `vars.mk` example

```makefile
NAME=mycontainer
VERSION=1.0
DESC=Short description
FULLDESC=Longer, user-facing description
```

Requirements and recommendations

- `Dockerfile` must exist for discovery.
- Prefer to `include ../templates/build.mk` in your `Makefile` unless you have specialized needs.
- Output expectations:
  - Image tarball (e.g., `$(NTAG).tar.gz`) must appear under `BUILD/debian/refplat-images-docker/var/lib/libvirt/images/...`.
  - Definition YAMLs must be generated into that same area.
- To opt out of builds, add an empty `.disabled` file in the container directory.

Local test flow

1. Build image and tarball:

```sh
make -C mycontainer
```

1. Generate definitions (if not already generated by build):

```sh
make -C mycontainer definitions
```

1. Build the package locally:

```sh
make deb
```

1. Confirm files:

- `BUILD/debian/refplat-images-docker/var/lib/libvirt/images/...`
- `*.deb`

CI test (manual run)

```sh
gh workflow run build-and-release.yml --ref <your-branch> -f create_release=false
```

## CI: GitHub Actions, artifacts & releases

Behavior

- The workflow discovers directories containing `Dockerfile` and without `.disabled` and builds them sequentially.
- After image builds, the workflow updates `BUILD/debian/changelog` and sets a timestamped package version: `<base>+YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` (UTC). The changelog entry message is exactly `auto-built on github on <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ>`.
- The workflow builds the `.deb` package and uploads Debian packaging artifacts: `*.deb`, `*.changes`, and `*.buildinfo`. It also creates a pruned tarball containing only the `var/lib/...` subtree named like `docker-refplat-images-<ts>.tar.gz` and uploads that tarball as an artifact and (optionally) attaches it to a GitHub Release.

### Manual triggers

Use the Actions UI "Run workflow" button or the GitHub CLI:

```sh
# run workflow on 'dev' without creating a release
gh workflow run build-and-release.yml --ref dev -f create_release=false

# run and create a release
gh workflow run build-and-release.yml --ref main -f create_release=true -f release_tag=v1.2.3 -f release_name="Release name"
```

### Permissions

- The workflow requires `permissions: contents: write` to create releases using the injected `GITHUB_TOKEN`. If your organization restricts this, use a PAT stored as a repository secret for the release steps or ask an admin to allow write permissions for the workflow.

### Artifact retention and storage

- Actions artifacts are retained for a limited period; this repository configures `retention-days: 10` for uploaded artifacts.
- Files attached to GitHub Releases persist until manually deleted.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build not skipped even though `.disabled` exists**: ensure the `.disabled` file is in the container directory (e.g., `chrome/.disabled`) and you are running the updated Makefiles. The repository Makefiles include guards that skip builds and definitions when `.disabled` is present.

- **`docker image inspect` or "No such image" errors when generating definitions**: build the image first (`make -C <dir>`) before running `make definitions`. The `definitions` target now checks for the image and will skip if it is missing.

- **CI release step fails with `Resource not accessible by integration` (403)**: confirm `permissions: contents: write` is set and allowed for workflows. If the organization blocks write tokens, use a PAT in repository secrets and modify the release step to use it.

- **Artifacts are large**: consider attaching only the `.deb` to Releases for long-term storage or hosting very large artifacts externally.

## Handling Multi-Container (Docker Compose) Solutions

Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) is designed to treat each node in a topology as a single, self-contained service or application. While it might be tempting to directly deploy multi-container applications, often defined using `docker-compose`, into CML by attempting to split them into individual CML nodes, this approach is generally not recommended and can lead to significant complications.

**Why direct decomposition of Docker Compose is problematic in CML:**

- **Single Node, Single Container Model**: CML's architecture assumes a one-to-one relationship between a CML node and a container image. `docker-compose` solutions, by definition, orchestrate multiple containers that are tightly coupled and rely on specific internal networking configurations managed by `docker-compose`.
- **Networking Complexity**: `docker-compose` automatically sets up internal networks and service discovery for its constituent containers. Trying to replicate this complex internal networking using CML's external connections between individual nodes is incredibly difficult and prone to errors. CML's fabric is not designed to manage the intricate inter-container communication typically handled by `docker-compose`.
- **Increased Potential for Errors**: Attempting to manually stitch together `docker-compose` components as separate CML nodes can lead to misconfigurations, broken dependencies, and unpredictable behavior, making troubleshooting very challenging.

**Recommended Approach: Utilize an Ubuntu VM Node for Docker Compose Solutions**

For complex, multi-container applications that require `docker-compose` orchestration (e.g., Netbox, GitLab), the recommended and most robust solution within CML is to deploy them inside a single Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) node. This approach leverages the VM's capabilities to host the entire `docker-compose` environment.

**Steps for deploying a Docker Compose solution in a CML Ubuntu VM:**

1. **Add an Ubuntu Node**: In your CML lab, add an Ubuntu VM node to your topology.
1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Once the Ubuntu VM is running, connect to it and install Docker Engine and Docker Compose (or Docker CLI with Compose features) within the VM.
1. **Deploy your Application**: Copy your `docker-compose.yml` file and any necessary application data into the Ubuntu VM.
1. **Run Docker Compose**: Execute `docker-compose up -d` (or `docker compose up -d`) within the Ubuntu VM to start your multi-container application.
1. **Create a Custom Image (Optional but Recommended)**: After successfully deploying and configuring your application within the Ubuntu VM, you can create a custom image from its current state. This allows you to save the pre-configured VM as a new, custom node type, which can then be easily reused in future labs without repeating the setup steps. This custom image acts as a 'snapshot' of your configured environment.

This method ensures that the `docker-compose` application runs in its intended environment, with its internal networking and dependencies managed correctly, while CML interacts with this single, self-contained Ubuntu VM node. This aligns with CML's design philosophy and provides a much more stable and manageable solution for advanced container deployments.

## Special nodes

### IOS XRd

XRd builds require a binary XRd container from Cisco (licensing). Place the downloaded file (for example `xrd-control-plane-container-x86.<version>.tgz`) into the `xrd/` directory and ensure `vars.mk` matches the version. The build process will extract and process that archive.

### Netflow

Netflow depends on an older Debian package that is not present in modern distributions; Netflow is disabled by default.

### Splunk

Splunk images are large and disabled by default. Consider keeping Splunk out of automated builds unless required.

## Pro tips

- Copy an existing container directory (e.g., `chrome/` or `nginx/`) when creating a new container — it speeds onboarding and avoids missing variables.
- Keep Docker images small to reduce CI time and storage usage.
- Use the `gh` CLI to trigger workflows and inspect runs (`gh run list`, `gh run view <id>`).
